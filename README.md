# Chateau - Data explorer for RethinkDB.

RethinkDB already comes with a "data explorer", which is more like a query buider.
Chateau is a data explorer where you can manage your data without writing a single query.

It's still an alpha version so many features are missing, but it's enough if you want to
bootstrap a new application and use Chateau as a panel admin for you data.

You can think of Chateau like a PhpMyAdmin for RethinkDB.
